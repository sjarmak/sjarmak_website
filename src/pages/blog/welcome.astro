	<h2>Welcome!</h2>

	<p>Thanks for visiting my blog. This is a space where I share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings as a software engineer.</p>

	<h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

	<p>I write about:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Web Development</strong>: Modern frameworks, best practices, and lessons learned</li>
		<li><strong>Software Engineering</strong>: Architecture, design patterns, and problem-solving</li>
		<li><strong>Technology</strong>: Emerging trends and tools that catch my interest</li>
		<li><strong>Personal Projects</strong>: Building in public and sharing the journey</li>

	<h2>A Bit About This Site</h2>

	<p>This blog is built with:</p>

	<pre><code>{`const stack = {
  framework: "Astro",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS",
  content: "MDX",
  deployment: "Render",
};`}</code></pre>

	<p>It's designed to be fast, accessible, and easy to maintain. Static generation ensures quick page loads, and the clean design keeps the focus on the content.</p>
